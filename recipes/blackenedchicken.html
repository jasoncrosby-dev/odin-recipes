        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat until it is smoking hot, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>While the skillet is heating, mix paprika, cayenne, cumin, thyme, onion powder, white pepper, and salt together in a small bowl.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Spray chicken breasts on both sides with cooking spray, then coat evenly with spice mixture.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Place chicken in the hot pan and cook for 1 minute. Turn, and cook 1 minute on other side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
